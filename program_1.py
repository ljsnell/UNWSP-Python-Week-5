# Program #1: Kilometer Converter
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, 
# then converts that distance to miles.  The conversion formula is as follows:  
# Miles = kilometers x 0.6214.   
# The conversion must be done as a function with input and output.


def kilometer_conversion(kilometers):    
    miles = 0.0
